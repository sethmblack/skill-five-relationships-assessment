# Five Relationships Assessment

Analyze any interpersonal or organizational situation through the Confucian lens of roles and reciprocal duties. Every relationship carries obligations on both sides; disorder arises when these are unclear or unfulfilled.

---

## When to Use

- Confusion about what you owe or are owed in a relationship
- Conflict between parties who don't understand their mutual obligations
- Mentor-mentee, manager-subordinate, or peer relationship difficulties
- Family tensions around roles and responsibilities
- Assessing whether relationship expectations are appropriate
- Building new relationships with clear foundations

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| relationship | Yes | Description of the relationship(s) in question |
| parties | Yes | Who is involved and their current positions |
| conflict_or_question | No | The specific issue or uncertainty to resolve |

## The Confucian Framework

Confucius identified five fundamental relationships (Wulun) that structure human society:

| Relationship | Superior Role | Inferior Role | Superior's Duty | Inferior's Duty |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Ruler-Subject** | Leader/Manager | Follower/Employee | Benevolence, righteousness, care | Loyalty, diligence |
| **Parent-Child** | Parent/Elder | Child/Younger | Kindness, nurture, guidance | Filial piety, care in old age |
| **Husband-Wife** | Husband | Wife | Provision, protection, respect | Support, cooperation |
| **Elder-Younger** | Senior/Mentor | Junior/Mentee | Guidance, opportunity, care | Respect, deference, learning |
| **Friend-Friend** | Equal | Equal | Trustworthiness, honesty | Trustworthiness, honesty |

**Key insight:** The family is the training ground for all virtue. Master relationships at home, and public relationships follow naturally. "Filiality and respect for elders—are these not the roots of ren (benevolence)?"

---

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Relationship Type

What kind of relationship is this? Most situations involve one or more of:
- **Hierarchical authority** (ruler-subject): workplace, organizational, governmental
- **Nurturing care** (parent-child): parental, mentorship, teaching
- **Partnership** (husband-wife): life partners, business partners, committed collaborators
- **Generational/experiential** (elder-younger): mentor-mentee, senior-junior
- **Reciprocal equality** (friend-friend): peers, colleagues, chosen companions

**Key question:** What is the fundamental nature of this relationship?

### Step 2: Map the Reciprocal Duties

What does each party owe by virtue of their role?

For the **superior/elder** role:
- What guidance, protection, or care is owed?
- What opportunities or nurturing should be provided?
- What example should be set?

For the **inferior/younger** role:
- What respect and deference is owed?
- What loyalty and diligence should be shown?
- What learning stance is appropriate?

For **equal** relationships:
- What honesty and trustworthiness is mutual?
- What support and reliability is owed both ways?

**Key question:** What does each role require of its holder?

### Step 3: Assess Duty Fulfillment

Where are duties being fulfilled, and where neglected?

| Party | Duty Owed | Currently Fulfilling? | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| [Party A] | [Duty 1] | Yes/No/Partial | [What's observed] |

Consider both sides—dysfunction often involves both parties failing their roles in different ways.

**Key question:** Who is fulfilling their duties, and who is not?

### Step 4: Diagnose the Relational Disorder

What pattern of dysfunction emerges?

Common patterns:
- **One-sided failure**: One party neglects duties while the other fulfills theirs
- **Mutual failure**: Both parties neglect duties, creating downward spiral
- **Role confusion**: Parties don't agree on what type of relationship this is
- **Inappropriate expectations**: Duties expected don't match the relationship type
- **Power without care**: Superior role exercised without corresponding duties
- **Rights without responsibilities**: Benefits claimed without duties fulfilled

**Key question:** What is the pattern of relational dysfunction?

### Step 5: Prescribe Restoration

How can proper relationship be restored?

Consider:
- Which party should act first? (Often the superior role bears greater responsibility)
- What specific duties need attention?
- Does the relationship type itself need clarification?
- Are expectations appropriately matched to the relationship?
- What would signal genuine restoration?

**Confucius's counsel:** "The ruler's character is like wind; the character of common people is like grass. When the wind blows, the grass bends." Those in superior roles must act first and by example.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Five Relationships Assessment

### Relationship Analysis
**Relationship type:** [ruler-subject / parent-child / elder-younger / friend-friend / hybrid]
**Parties:** [Who holds which role]
**Current state:** [2-3 sentence summary of the relationship's condition]

### Duty Mapping
| Party | Role | Duties Owed | Currently Fulfilling |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| [A] | [role] | [list] | [assessment] |
| [B] | [role] | [list] | [assessment] |

### Diagnosis
**Pattern of dysfunction:** [Name the pattern]
**Root cause:** [Where the relationship went wrong]

### Self-Examination Prompt
Before prescribing action for others, consider:
- [Question for the person asking to examine themselves]
- [Question about their own fulfillment of duties]

### Prescription for Restoration
**For [Party A]:**
[Specific duties to fulfill and how]

**For [Party B]:**
[Specific duties to fulfill and how]

**Who should act first:** [Party and reasoning]

### The Path to Harmony
[Vision of what restored relationship looks like]
```

## Constraints

- Always consider both parties' duties—dysfunction is rarely one-sided
- Those in superior roles bear greater responsibility to act first
- Distinguish between relationship types—duties differ accordingly
- Include self-examination before prescribing change in others
- Recognize that some relationships are genuinely broken and may need redefinition

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My direct report seems resentful of feedback. I'm their manager and it's my job to help them improve, but they act like I'm attacking them. How do I handle this?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Five Relationships Assessment

### Relationship Analysis
**Relationship type:** Ruler-subject (manager-subordinate), with elements of elder-younger (mentor-mentee)
**Parties:** You hold the manager/mentor role; your report holds the subordinate/learner role
**Current state:** Feedback, which should be a gift of the superior role, is received as attack. Either the giving or receiving (or both) has gone wrong.

### Duty Mapping
| Party | Role | Duties Owed | Currently Fulfilling |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| You (Manager) | Superior/Guide | Benevolence, developmental care, honest assessment, opportunity | Unclear—giving feedback, but is it developmental or critical? |
| Report | Subordinate/Learner | Diligence, openness to guidance, loyalty, respect | Partial—present but defensive; respect may be compromised |

### Diagnosis
**Pattern of dysfunction:** Role confusion combined with possible power-without-care
**Root cause:** The relationship may have become primarily evaluative rather than developmental. When feedback is experienced as judgment rather than guidance, the subordinate's natural response is defense, not learning.

### Self-Examination Prompt
Before prescribing action for your report, consider:
- When you give feedback, is your intention genuinely their development, or is it correction of what frustrates you?
- Do you give more criticism than recognition? The junzi builds people up.
- Have you earned the trust that makes feedback feel like care rather than attack?
- When they push back, do you become more forceful, or do you inquire into their perspective?

### Prescription for Restoration

**For You (Manager):**
1. **Fulfill the care duty first.** Before the next feedback conversation, invest in understanding their aspirations. What do they want to become? Feedback lands differently when it clearly serves *their* goals.

2. **Examine your ratio.** Track for one week: how many developmental/positive observations do you make versus critical ones? If criticism dominates, the relationship has become primarily corrective. That is not the superior role properly fulfilled.

3. **Inquire before declaring.** "I've observed X. What's your perspective on it?" opens dialogue. "You need to improve X" closes it.

4. **Name the relationship you want.** "I see my role as helping you succeed. When I share feedback, it's in service of that. If it's not landing that way, I want to know."

**For Your Report:**
Their duty is openness to guidance—but that duty becomes possible when trust is established. Your action precedes theirs.

**Who should act first:** You. "If a ruler sets himself right, he will be followed without his command." The superior role carries the responsibility to create the conditions for the inferior role to be fulfilled.

### The Path to Harmony
A restored relationship looks like: you offer observations in service of their growth; they receive them as care, ask clarifying questions, and apply what serves them. Feedback becomes a gift exchanged between people with aligned interests in the subordinate's development. The resentment dissolves because the relationship is no longer evaluative but genuinely developmental.
